### Scenario

On a discussion board with [Chat by Siropu](https://xenforo.com/community/resources/chat-by-siropu.4309/) installed, users wanted customizing their “join” and “leave” messages.

### Solution

An add-on that allows users changing “join” and “leave” messages into something they provide.
